`gym-anm` is a framework for designing reinforcement learning (RL) environments that model Active Network
Management (ANM) tasks in electricity distribution networks. It is built on top of the
[Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) toolkit.

The `gym-anm` framework was designed with one goal in mind: **bridge the gap between research in RL and in
the management of power systems**. We attempt to do this by providing RL researchers with an easy-to-work-with
library of environments that model decision-making tasks in power grids.

**Papers:**
*  [Gym-ANM: Reinforcement Learning Environments for Active Network Management Tasks in Electricity Distribution Systems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyai.2021.100092)
*  [Gym-ANM: Open-source software to leverage reinforcement learning for power system management in research and education](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpa.2021.100092)

## Key features
*  Very little background in electricity systems modelling it required. This makes `gym-anm` an ideal starting point
   for RL students and researchers looking to enter the field.
*  The environments (tasks) generated by `gym-anm` follow the [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium)
   framework, with which a large part of the RL community is already familiar.
*  The flexibility of `gym-anm`, with its different customizable components, makes it a suitable framework
   to model a wide range of ANM tasks, from simple ones that can be used for educational purposes, to complex ones
   designed to conduct advanced research.

## Documentation
Documentation is provided online at [https://gym-anm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://gym-anm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Installation

### Requirements
`gym-anm` requires Python 3.10+ and can run on Linux, MaxOS, and Windows. Some rendering features may not work properly
on Windows (not tested).

If you need Python 3.8 or 3.9, you can use `gym-anm < 2.0`.

We recommend installing `gym-anm` in a Python environment (e.g., [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
or [conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/#)).

### Using pip
Using pip (preferably after activating your virtual environment):
```
pip install gym-anm
```

### Building from source
Alternatively, you can build `gym-anm` directly from source:
```
git clone https://github.com/robinhenry/gym-anm.git
cd gym-anm
pip install -e .
```

## Example
The following code snippet illustrates how `gym-anm` environments can be used. In this example,
actions are randomly sampled from the action space of the environment `ANM6Easy-v0`. For more information
about the agent-environment interface, see the official [Gymnasium documentation](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium).
```
import gymnasium as gym
import time

def run():
   env = gym.make('gym_anm:ANM6Easy-v0')
   o = env.reset()

   for i in range(100):
       a = env.action_space.sample()
       o, r, done, info = env.step(a)
       env.render()
       time.sleep(0.5)  # otherwise the rendering is too fast for the human eye.

   env.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()
```
The above code would render the environment in your default web browser as shown in the image below:

Additional example scripts can be found in [examples/](examples).

## Testing the installation
All unit tests in `gym-anm` can be ran from the project root directory with:
```
python -m pytest tests
```
