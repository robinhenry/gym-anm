"""
This script shows how to run the MPC-based DC OPF policy
:math:`\\pi_{MPC-N}^{constant}` in an arbitrary gym-anm
environment.

This policy assumes constant demand and generation during the
optimization horizon.

For more information, see https://gym-anm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/mpc.html#constant-forecast.
