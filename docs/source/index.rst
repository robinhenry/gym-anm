What is it?
-----------
:code:`gym-anm` is a framework for designing reinforcement learning (RL) environments that model Active Network
Management (ANM) tasks in electricity distribution networks.

RL is a vibrant field, but it still heavily relies on the availability of software-based simulators of the
real world to design and train its agents.

Unfortunately, power systems are complex dynamical systems and their modelling often requires extensive
knowledge in power system engineering. We believe this is the main reason why decision-making problems
in power systems have drawn less attention over the last decade than other domains in which RL has
been successfully and extensively applied, such as the fields of games, robotics, and autonomous driving.

On the other side, few researchers in the field of power system control have the necessary background
knowledge to understand, stay up-to-date with, and apply the latest research in RL to their own problems.

The :code:`gym-anm` framework was thus designed with one goal in mind: **bridge the gap between research in RL and in
the management of power systems**. We attempt to do this by providing RL researchers with an easy-to-work-with
library of environments that model decision-making tasks in power grids.


Key features
------------
*  Very little background in electricity systems modelling is required. This makes :code:`gym-anm` an ideal starting point
   for RL students and researchers looking to enter the field.
*  The environments (tasks) generated by :code:`gym-anm` follow the `Gymnasium <https://gymnasium.farama.org/>`_
   framework, with which a large part of the RL community is already familiar.
*  The flexibility of :code:`gym-anm`, with its different customizable components, makes it a suitable framework
   to model a wide range of ANM tasks, from simple ones that can be used for educational purposes, to complex ones
   designed to conduct advanced research (see :ref:`design_new_env`).


Example
-------
An example of an environment built with the :code:`gym-anm` framework is the :ref:`ANM6Easy-v0 <anm6_label>` task, which
comes with its own rendering tool:
